# Task 4.3 — Enforce structured output using tool use and JSON schemas

> Domain 4: Prompt Engineering & Structured Output. Excerpted from the official guide.

## Knowledge of
- **Tool use (`tool_use`) with JSON schemas** as the most reliable approach for guaranteed schema-compliant structured output, eliminating JSON syntax errors.
- The distinction between `tool_choice: "auto"` (model may return text instead of calling a tool), `"any"` (model must call a tool but can choose which), and **forced tool selection** (model must call a specific named tool).
- That strict JSON schemas via tool use **eliminate syntax errors** but **do not prevent semantic errors** (e.g., line items that don't sum to total, values in wrong fields).
- Schema design considerations: required vs optional fields, enum fields with `"other"` + detail string patterns for extensible categories.

## Skills in
- Defining extraction tools with JSON schemas as input parameters and extracting structured data from the `tool_use` response.
- Setting `tool_choice: "any"` to **guarantee structured output** when multiple extraction schemas exist and the document type is unknown.
- Forcing a specific tool with `tool_choice: {"type": "tool", "name": "extract_metadata"}` to ensure a particular extraction runs before enrichment steps.
- Designing schema fields as **optional (nullable)** when source documents may not contain the information, preventing the model from fabricating values to satisfy required fields.
- Adding enum values like `"unclear"` for ambiguous cases and `"other"` + detail fields for extensible categorization.
- Including **format normalization rules** in prompts alongside strict output schemas to handle inconsistent source formatting.
