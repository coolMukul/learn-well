# Task 3.5 — Apply iterative refinement techniques for progressive improvement

> Domain 3: Claude Code Configuration & Workflows. Excerpted from the official guide.

## Knowledge of
- **Concrete input/output examples** as the most effective way to communicate expected transformations when prose descriptions are interpreted inconsistently.
- **Test-driven iteration**: writing test suites first, then iterating by sharing test failures to guide progressive improvement.
- The **interview pattern**: having Claude ask questions to surface considerations the developer may not have anticipated before implementing.
- When to provide all issues in a **single message** (interacting problems) versus fixing them **sequentially** (independent problems).

## Skills in
- Providing 2-3 concrete input/output examples to clarify transformation requirements when natural language descriptions produce inconsistent results.
- Writing test suites covering expected behavior, edge cases, and performance requirements before implementation, then iterating by sharing test failures.
- Using the interview pattern to surface design considerations (e.g., cache invalidation strategies, failure modes) before implementing solutions in unfamiliar domains.
- Providing specific test cases with example input and expected output to fix edge case handling (e.g., null values in migration scripts).
- Addressing multiple **interacting** issues in a single detailed message when fixes interact, versus **sequential** iteration for independent issues.
