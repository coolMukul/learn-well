# Task 1.7 — Manage session state, resumption, and forking

> Domain 1: Agentic Architecture & Orchestration. Excerpted from the official guide.

## Knowledge of
- **Named session resumption** using `--resume <session-name>` to continue a specific prior conversation.
- `fork_session` for creating independent branches from a shared analysis baseline to explore divergent approaches.
- The importance of informing the agent about changes to previously analyzed files when resuming sessions after code modifications.
- Why starting a new session with a structured summary is more reliable than resuming with stale tool results.

## Skills in
- Using `--resume` with session names to continue named investigation sessions across work sessions.
- Using `fork_session` to create parallel exploration branches (e.g., comparing two testing strategies or refactoring approaches from a shared codebase analysis).
- Choosing between **session resumption** (when prior context is mostly valid) and **starting fresh with injected summaries** (when prior tool results are stale).
- Informing a resumed session about specific file changes for **targeted re-analysis** rather than requiring full re-exploration.
