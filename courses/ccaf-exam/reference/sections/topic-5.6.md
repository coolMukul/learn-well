# Task 5.6 — Preserve information provenance and handle uncertainty in multi-source synthesis

> Domain 5: Context Management & Reliability. Excerpted from the official guide.

## Knowledge of
- How **source attribution is lost** during summarization steps when findings are compressed without preserving claim-source mappings.
- The importance of **structured claim-source mappings** that the synthesis agent must preserve and merge when combining findings.
- How to handle **conflicting statistics from credible sources**: annotating conflicts with source attribution rather than arbitrarily selecting one value.
- **Temporal data**: requiring publication/collection dates in structured outputs to prevent temporal differences from being misinterpreted as contradictions.

## Skills in
- Requiring subagents to output structured claim-source mappings (source URLs, document names, relevant excerpts) that downstream agents preserve through synthesis.
- Structuring reports with **explicit sections** distinguishing well-established findings from contested ones, preserving original source characterizations and methodological context.
- Completing document analysis with **conflicting values included and explicitly annotated**, letting the coordinator decide how to reconcile before passing to synthesis.
- Requiring subagents to include publication or data collection dates in structured outputs to enable correct temporal interpretation.
- Rendering different content types appropriately in synthesis outputs — **financial data as tables, news as prose, technical findings as structured lists** — rather than converting everything to a uniform format.
