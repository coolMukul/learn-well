# Task 2.1 — Design effective tool interfaces with clear descriptions and boundaries

> Domain 2: Tool Design & MCP Integration. Excerpted from the official guide.

## Knowledge of
- **Tool descriptions are the primary mechanism LLMs use for tool selection**; minimal descriptions lead to unreliable selection among similar tools.
- The importance of including **input formats, example queries, edge cases, and boundary explanations** in tool descriptions.
- How ambiguous or overlapping tool descriptions cause misrouting (e.g., `analyze_content` vs `analyze_document` with near-identical descriptions).
- The impact of system prompt wording on tool selection: keyword-sensitive instructions can create unintended tool associations.

## Skills in
- Writing tool descriptions that clearly differentiate each tool's **purpose, expected inputs, outputs, and when to use it versus similar alternatives**.
- Renaming tools and updating descriptions to eliminate functional overlap (e.g., renaming `analyze_content` to `extract_web_results` with a web-specific description).
- Splitting generic tools into purpose-specific tools with defined input/output contracts (e.g., splitting `analyze_document` into `extract_data_points`, `summarize_content`, `verify_claim_against_source`).
- Reviewing system prompts for keyword-sensitive instructions that might override well-written tool descriptions.
