# Task 5.5 — Design human review workflows and confidence calibration

> Domain 5: Context Management & Reliability. Excerpted from the official guide.

## Knowledge of
- The risk that **aggregate accuracy metrics** (e.g., 97% overall) may **mask poor performance** on specific document types or fields.
- **Stratified random sampling** for measuring error rates in high-confidence extractions and detecting novel error patterns.
- **Field-level confidence scores** calibrated using labeled validation sets for routing review attention.
- The importance of **validating accuracy by document type and field segment** before automating high-confidence extractions.

## Skills in
- Implementing stratified random sampling of high-confidence extractions for ongoing error rate measurement and novel pattern detection.
- Analyzing accuracy by document type and field to verify consistent performance across all segments before reducing human review.
- Having models output **field-level confidence scores**, then calibrating review thresholds using labeled validation sets.
- Routing extractions with **low model confidence** or ambiguous/contradictory source documents to human review, prioritizing limited reviewer capacity.
